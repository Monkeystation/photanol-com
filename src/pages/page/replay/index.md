    paragraph: The demand for plastic packaging is predicted to triple by 2050,
      bringing about well-recognized problems around limited fossil feedstocks,
      global warming, environmental pollution, and a lack of material recycling.
      Biodegradable bioplastics offer a promising solution to decouple from
      fossil feedstocks. Especially the most common bioplastic polylactic acid
      (PLA), made from lactic acid, will play a prominent role in replacing the
      conventional packaging market. PLA production currently depends mainly on
      food crops as key feedstock. Moreover, it requires significant amounts of
      water and land. Hence, if the need for bioplastic continues to grow, there
      will be competition for food and fresh water, price volatility and
      environmental consequences. New bioplastic production technologies that
      rely on raw materials, which are abundantly available, are urgently needed
      to meet the demand for >285 million tons of packaging by 2050.

    paragraph: The H2020 RePLAy project focusses on the development of Photanol's
      proprietary technology to produce lactic acid, the key ingredient for PLA,
      directly out of CO₂ and sunlight. This revolutionary platform technology
      is based on the combination genetically optimized bacterial strains and
      tailor-made photo-bioreactors, enabling a production efficacy that is 7x
      higher than crop plants. By directly converting its limitless available
      CO₂ feedstock into lactic acid, Photanol can price-compete with
      petrochemicals and decouple from food feedstock. In the process 1.6 tonnes
      CO₂ are captured per ton lactic acid and 24x less land and 25x water are
      used compared to current methods. Photanol has reached important upscaling
      milestones obtaining permits and successful construction and operation of
      a first-of-a-kind outside pilot and demo plant.

    paragraph: >-
      Our demo plant has the capacity to produce up to 10 tons per year. It’s
      the intermediary step to producing the kilotons needed for large scale
      commercial needs. It’s also the testing ground for fine-tuning processes
      and discovering the optimum equilibrium between investment and returns.
      Proving that when upscaled, the Photanol process can produce as cost
      efficiently as old school fossil fuel operations. And, in the long term
      with even better economics.


      Our first commercial plant is planned to kick-off production in 2024. Rest assured, our teams are working hard to optimize and maximize production. Constantly iterating to evidence that Photanol is not only the most future-proof solution but also the solution with the lowest footprint of any sustainable option. Our economically sound business cases and new tech breakthroughs acting as instruments in our mission to restore balance to the planet, while powering the world.
