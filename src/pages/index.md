      text: "In 2008, Prof. Klaas Hellingwerf and Prof. Joost Teixeira de Mattos
        pooled their respective expertise to address climate change. They
        theorized it was possible to adapt cyanobacteria to synthesize ethanol.
        With the potential to create any carbon chemical. The real game-changer?
        Absorbing CO<small>2</small>. Based on cyanobacteria’s power to
        photosynthesize, the process the professors dreamt up extracts
        CO<small>2</small> from the atmosphere while producing essential
        industrial compounds. Months of iteration in the lab led to success, our
        first patent and the birth of Photanol’s renewable revolution. "

      text: >-
        In order to nurture our fledgling circular ambitions, we needed to
        demonstrate commercial potential. Our technology must be capable of
        producing an entire platform of compounds. Transforming any chemical to
        a sustainable one. Early investment rounds allowed us to form a
        dedicated Photanol team to power the effort.


        They validated that our first patent could lead to many more; enhancing cyanobacteria for 17 individual strains. Proving that what we had on our hands could rock the world. We were officially in the business of restoring balance on our planet.

        Early success delivered the perfect moment for a partner with a shared
        vision for circular chemistry. One with specific expertise and a
        commercial need. Corbion is a fermentation expert. They produce lactic
        acid from beet or cane sugar – the raw material needed for PLA (poly
        lactic acid used for biodegradable bioplastic packaging).


        The partnership with Corbion enabled us to develop renewable lactic acid with highest purity; made from CO<small>2</small>. Using 24 times less land and 25 times less water than traditional equivalents.

      text: A key ingredient in the global cosmetics industry, glycolic acid was our
        next target. To develop a circular solution in this field, we partnered
        with Nouryon. With two significant partners on board, proven scalability
        of both our circular organic acids - lactic and glycolic – became the
        key milestones at our debut pilot plants.
    - year: "2019"
      title: Pilot plant validation
      text: For each proven chemical, early wins in the lab must transform into
        processes that can scale. Over the course of eight years we validated
        our organic acids, producing consistently good results over prolonged
        periods at kg scale, at three different plants. Both Corbion and Nouryon
        proved their strategic value by contributing decades of downstream
        expertise. Photanol was now able to demonstrate cost, waste and energy
        efficiency throughout the entire process.

        powerhouse is backing the Photanol mission - signing a partnership
        agreement. With Renolit joining the Photanol journey, we can bring
        circular innovation to yet another industry - healthcare. Renolit
        applies polymers in the global medical world and will iterate with
        Photanol tech to provide truly circular production of plastics (PP/PE)
        for this essential sector, as well as for the Renolit Group’s other
        applications.

        the intermediary step to producing the kilotons needed for large scale
        commercial needs. It’s also the testing ground for fine-tuning processes
        and discovering the optimum equilibrium between investment and returns.
        Proving that when upscaled, the Photanol process can produce as cost
        efficiently as old school fossil fuel operations. And, in the long term
        with even better economics. After biochemicals, biofuels are Photanol’s
        next disruptive ambition.

        blueprint: once fine-tuned and optimized, reaching commercial scale
        ‘simply’ means joining together a 100 copies of our demo plant.
        Manufacturing capacity will increase to around 30,000 tonnes. Applying
        the learnings from the smaller scale demo set-up while embracing
        engineering insights from industries like agriculture, water treatment
        plants and others. Methodology that will enable Photanol to compete
        extremely favorably with non-renewable chemicals. Proving that
        sustainability isn’t second place to economic profit."

  title: "Cyanobacteria: natural, all-in-one factories."
  text: >-
    Petro-chemicals mean mining more fossil fuel, emitting more carbon. They’re
    also resource, land and time thirsty - the kind of industry that has led to
    a planet out of balance. The Photanol solution helps reset that balance. 


    We can create any carbon compound. Which means we can make the monomers used for different plastics, the ingredients for personal care products and detergents; even fuels - clean, renewable and circular. All thanks to innovation that follows nature’s lead. 


    Photanol works with the superpower of cyanobacteria to photosynthesize. Optimizing the bacteria to absorb more CO<small>2</small>, adapting its metabolic pathways to produce a desired chemical. Transforming the bacteria into highly-efficient mini factories that run on sunlight, produce just oxygen as by-product and need radically less land and water than traditional variants. All primed for scalability thanks to Photanol’s platform technology.
