      text: "Our biotech revolution was officially born when we gained our first
        patent. Filed in 2008 by Prof. Klaas Hellingwerf (our CSO). Prof. Klaas’
        lab trials at UvA (University of Amsterdam) led to the successful
        initial findings around cyano-bacteria’s sustainable superpowers. "

      text: >
        In order to nurture our fledgling circular revolution, we needed to
        demonstrate our commercial potential; evidencing that our technology
        could produce an entire platform of compounds. Transforming any chemical
        to sustainable. 


        Thanks to early investment we were able to form a dedicated Photanol team. The team went on to prove that our first patent could lead to many more; enhancing cyano-bacteria for 17 individual strains. And, that what we had on our hands could rock the world. We were officially in the business of restoring balance on our planet.

      text: >-
        A partner with a specific expertise and commercial need; Corbion is a
        fermentation expert. They make a whole load of lactic acid – the raw
        material needed for PLA (poly lactic acid used for biodegradable
        bioplastic packaging). Industrial PLA uses heaps of land and water,
        produces CO2 and is generally not great for the environmental footprint
        of global corporations. 


        Thanks to our Corbion collab, we are able to synthesize lactic acid with huge mechanical strength, low toxicity, low flammability, using 40 times less land and 10.000 times less water.

      text: Glycolic acid was our next target. Widely used in the cosmetics industry,
        with over 95% of the world’s cosmetic products containing it. To develop
        our circular strain, we partnered with Nouryon (the sustainable
        chemicals division of AkzoNobel). Our next feat would be to show the
        scalability of both our circular acids - lactic and glycolic – in
        Photanol’s debut pilot plants.
    - year: "2019"
      title: Pilot plant validation
      text: For each proven chemical, our next step is to take lab scale success and
        validate it at commercial scale. Over the course of [XX] years we
        produced consistently good results over prolonged periods at -kg scale,
        validating our two circular acids at three different pilot plants. Both
        our strategic partners brought downstream expertise to the table, so we
        could prove cost, waste and energy efficiency throughout the entire
        process.

    - text: "Our most recent triumph was securing the funding for the first commercial
        scale plant. The Photanol process takes place in tubes. So, in essence,
        when we scale up it’s as simple as laying more tubes and making sure we
        have enough sunlight to power our tech. Then it’s a case of just letting
        the cyano-bacteria perform its natural magic. Bolstered by financing
        from four new investors, our first demo unit in Delfzijl, the
        Netherlands, will be ready to roll at the end of 2020. "

    - text: "This grand milestone, and bricks and mortar proof of our game-changer
        power will produce up to 10 tons per year. It’s the intermediary step to
        producing the kilotons needed for the largest scale commercial needs.
        Our premiere plant proves that when upscaled, the Photanol process can
        produce as cost effectively as old school fossil fuel operations. And,
        in the long term – more cost efficiently. After biochemicals, biofuels
        are Photanol’s next chapter. "

        paving the way to prove our capabilities in yet another sector;
        healthcare. Renolit produces polymers for the global medical world and
        will iterate with Photanol tech for this essential sector, as well as
        for the Renoit Group’s other applications.

  pretitle: WE WORK WITH CYANO-BACTERIA
  title: A natural, all-in-one circular factory
  text: >-
    Today’s petrochemicals used for our daily plastics, materials and products
    mean mining more fossil fuels, pumping more carbon into the atmosphere. Yet
    scientists agree we have less than ten years before the point of the no
    return, if we continue business as unusual. 


    Photanol is business as unusual. 


    We can make any chemical compound - and therefore the monomers and polymers used for different plastics - clean, renewable and circular. Leaving fossil fuel in the ground. Extracting CO2  from the atmosphere. Using just sunlight and water. We do it with innovation that follows nature’s lead. 


    Photanol’s platform technology uses the natural power of cyano-bacteria; the bacteria that uses sunlight to drive photosynthesis - to create any organic acid. Think of it as an all-in-one, renewable factory. The Photanol process absorbs CO2 - transforming it from harmful waste energy into circular feedstock, and adapts the cyano-bacteria’s metabolic pathways to produce any desired chemical. Super efficiently and with just oxygen as downstream by-product.
