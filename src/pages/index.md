  pretitle: WE WORK WITH CYANO-BACTERIA
  title: A natural, all-in-one circular factory
  text: >-
    Today’s petrochemicals used for our daily plastics, materials and products
    mean mining more fossil fuels, pumping more carbon into the atmosphere. Yet
    scientists agree we have less than ten years before the point of the no
    return, if we continue business as unusual. 


    Photanol is business as unusual. 


    We can make any chemical compound - and therefore the monomers and polymers used for different plastics - clean, renewable and circular. Leaving fossil fuel in the ground. Extracting CO2  from the atmosphere. Using just sunlight and water. We do it with innovation that follows nature’s lead. 


    Photanol’s platform technology uses the natural power of cyano-bacteria; the bacteria that uses sunlight to drive photosynthesis - to create any organic acid. Think of it as an all-in-one, renewable factory. The Photanol process absorbs CO2 - transforming it from harmful waste energy into circular feedstock, and adapts the cyano-bacteria’s metabolic pathways to produce any desired chemical. Super efficiently and with just oxygen as downstream by-product.
