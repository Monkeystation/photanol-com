      text: "Our biotech revolution was officially born when we gained our first
        patent. Filed in 2008 by Prof. Klaas Hellingwerf (our CSO). Prof. Klaas’
        lab trials at UvA (University of Amsterdam) led to the successful
        initial findings around cyano-bacteria’s sustainable superpowers. "

        In order to nurture our fledgling circular revolution, we needed to
        demonstrate our commercial potential; evidencing that our technology
        could produce an entire platform of compounds. Transforming any chemical
        to sustainable. 


        Thanks to early investment we were able to form a dedicated Photanol team. The team went on to prove that our first patent could lead to many more; enhancing cyano-bacteria for 17 individual strains. And, that what we had on our hands could rock the world. We were officially in the business of restoring balance on our planet.
    - year: "2014"
      title: Strategic partnership with Corbion

      text: >-
        A partner with a specific expertise and commercial need; Corbion is a
        fermentation expert. They make a whole load of lactic acid – the raw
        material needed for PLA (poly lactic acid used for biodegradable
        bioplastic packaging). Industrial PLA uses heaps of land and water,
        produces CO2 and is generally not great for the environmental footprint
        of global corporations. 


        Thanks to our Corbion collab, we are able to synthesize lactic acid with huge mechanical strength, low toxicity, low flammability, using 40 times less land and 10.000 times less water. 
    - year: "2016"
      title: Strategic partnership with Nouryon
      icon: /img/roadmap_partnerships.png
      image: /img/nouryonplade.png
      text: Glycolic acid was our next target. Widely used in the cosmetics industry,
        with over 95% of the world’s cosmetic products containing it. To develop
        our circular strain, we partnered with Nouryon (the sustainable
        chemicals division of AkzoNobel). Our next feat would be to show the
        scalability of both our circular acids - lactic and glycolic – in
        Photanol’s debut pilot plants.
    - year: "2019"
      title: Pilot plant validation
      text: For each proven chemical, our next step is to take lab scale success and
        validate it at commercial scale. Over the course of [XX] years we
        produced consistently good results over prolonged periods at -kg scale,
        validating our two circular acids at three different pilot plants. Both
        our strategic partners brought downstream expertise to the table, so we
        could prove cost, waste and energy efficiency throughout the entire
        process.

      image: /img/4-pilot-plant-validation.jpg
    - text: "Our most recent triumph was securing the funding for the first commercial
        scale plant. The Photanol process takes place in tubes. So, in essence,
        when we scale up it’s as simple as laying more tubes and making sure we
        have enough sunlight to power our tech. Then it’s a case of just letting
        the cyano-bacteria perform its natural magic. Bolstered by financing
        from four new investors, our first demo unit in Delfzijl, the
        Netherlands, will be ready to roll at the end of 2020. "

    - text: "This grand milestone, and bricks and mortar proof of our game-changer
        power will produce up to 10 tons per year. It’s the intermediary step to
        producing the kilotons needed for the largest scale commercial needs.
        Our premiere plant proves that when upscaled, the Photanol process can
        produce as cost effectively as old school fossil fuel operations. And,
        in the long term – more cost efficiently. After biochemicals, biofuels
        are Photanol’s next chapter. "

    - text: Our third strategic partnership joined the Photanol journey in 2020,
        paving the way to prove our capabilities in yet another sector;
        healthcare. Renolit produces polymers for the global medical world and
        will iterate with Photanol tech for this essential sector, as well as
        for the Renoit Group’s other applications.

    - title: Scale up to commercial plant
      year: "2023"
      text: The next milestone-in-the-works is proving commercial viability for global
        manufacturing needs. Meaning a lego-block-style upscale a 100 times that
        of the demo plant. Manufacturing around 30,000 tonnes. Applying the
        learnings from the smaller scale demo set-up while embracing engineering
        insights from lateral industry like agriculture. Methodology that will
        enable Photanol to compete extremely favourably with non-renewable
        chemicals. Proving that sustainability is also a far better business
        case.

    - year: "2024"
      title: Commercial production
      text: Our first commercial plant is pencilled to kick-off production in 2024.
        First finance rounds are scheduled for 2021. Meanwhile, the upscaling
        teams are working hard to optimize and maximize production by minimizing
        fluctuating factors like sun hours. Constantly iterating to evidence
        that Photanol is not only the most future-proof solution, but also the
        solution with the lowest footprint of any sustainable option. New tech
        breakthroughs speeding up our ambition to restore balance along the way.

  pretitle: HOW IT WORKS
  title: Our natural, all-in-one factories
  text: >
    Photanol is business-as-natural. 


    We can make any compound, and therefore the monomers and polymers used for different plastics - clean, renewable and circular. Leaving fossil fuel in the ground. Extracting CO2  from the air. Using just sunlight and minimal water. We do it with innovation that follows nature’s lead. 


    Photanol uses the superpower of cyano-bacteria to photosynthesize. Creating a natural, all-in-one factory. We enhance the bacteria to absorb CO2 (transforming it from waste energy into circular feedstock). Then adapt its metabolic pathways to produce any desired chemical. Supremely efficient. With just oxygen as by-product. Primed for scalability thanks to Photanol’s platform technology.
