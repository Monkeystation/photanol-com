      title: The first patent
      icon: /img/roadmap_patent.png
      image: /img/timeline-1.png
      text: "In 2008, Prof. Klaas Hellingwerf and Prof. Joost Teixeira de Mattos
        pooled their respective expertise to address climate change. They
        theorized it was possible to adapt bacteria to synthesize ethanol. With
        the potential to create any carbon chemical. The real game-changer?
        Absorbing CO2. Based on cyanobacteria’s power to photosynthesize, the
        process the professors dreamt up extracts CO2 from the atmosphere while
        producing essential industrial compounds. Months of iteration in the lab
        led to success, our first patent and the birth of Photanol’s renewable
        revolution. "
    - year: "2012"
      title: Platform spin-out

      text: >-
        In order to nurture our fledgling circular ambitions, we needed to
        demonstrate commercial potential. Our technology must be capable of
        producing an entire platform of compounds. Transforming any chemical to
        a sustainable one. Early investment rounds allowed us to form a
        dedicated Photanol team to power the effort.


        They validated that our first patent could lead to many more; enhancing cyanobacteria for 17 individual strains. Proving that what we had on our hands could rock the world. We were officially in the business of restoring balance on our planet.
    - year: "2014"
      title: Strategic partnership with Corbion
      icon: /img/roadmap_partnerships.png
      image: /img/corbion.jpg
      text: >-
        Early success delivered the perfect moment for a partner with a shared
        vision for circular chemistry. One with specific expertise and a
        commercial need. Corbion is a fermentation expert. They produce lactic
        acid – the raw material needed for PLA (poly lactic acid used for
        biodegradable bioplastic packaging).


        The partnership with Corbion enabled us to develop renewable lactic acid with highest purity; made from CO<sub>2</sub>. Using 24 times less land and 25 times less water than traditional equivalents.
    - year: "2016"
      title: Strategic partnership with Nouryon
      icon: /img/roadmap_partnerships.png
      image: /img/nouryonplade.png
      text: A key ingredient in the global cosmetics industry, glycolic acid was our
        next target. To develop a circular solution in this field, we partnered
        with Nouryon. With two significant partners on board, proven scalability
        of both our circular organic acids - lactic and glycolic – became the
        key milestones at our debut pilot plants.
    - year: "2019"
      title: Pilot plant validation
      text: For each proven chemical, early wins in the lab must transform into
        processes that can scale. Over the course of eight years we validated
        our organic acids, producing consistently good results over prolonged
        periods at kg scale, at three different plants. Both Corbion and Nouryon
        proved their strategic value by contributing decades of downstream
        expertise. Photanol was now able to demonstrate cost, waste and energy
        efficiency throughout the entire process.

    - text: "Fresh off the press in September 2020: We are live at our first
        demonstration scale plant in Delfzijl. Cyanobacteria have been set free
        across thousands of meters of tubing laid out in a controlled
        greenhouse. Sunlight powering the bacteria’s productive magic. Creating
        a massive and very impressive bio-plant. All with big thanks to funding
        from four new investors. "
      year: "2020"
      title: First demonstration plant
      icon: /img/roadmap_construction.png
      image: /img/5-first-demonstration-plant.jpg
    - text: Our demo plant has the capacity to produce up to 10 tons per year. It’s
        the intermediary step to producing the kilotons needed for large scale
        commercial needs. It’s also the testing ground for fine-tuning processes
        and discovering the optimum equilibrium between investment and returns.
        Proving that when upscaled, the Photanol process can produce as cost
        efficiently as old school fossil fuel operations. And, in the long term
        with even better economics. After biochemicals, biofuels are Photanol’s
        next disruptive ambition.

    - text: We admit we’re a tad ambitious, and the goals we set often keep us up at
        night. But it’s also led us to two great partners. Now, a third
        powerhouse is backing the Photanol mission - signing a partnership
        agreement. With Renolit joining the Photanol journey, we can bring
        circular innovation to yet another industry - healthcare. Renolit
        applies polymers in the global medical world and will iterate with
        Photanol tech to provide truly circular production of plastics (PP/PE)
        for this essential sector, as well as for the Renolit Group’s other
        applications.

    - title: Scale up to commercial plant
      year: "2023"
      text: "Proving commercial viability for global manufacturing needs is next.
        Photonal is like a lego-block-style blueprint: once fine-tuned and
        optimized, reaching commercial scale ‘simply’ means joining together a
        100 copies of our demo plant. Manufacturing capacity will increase to
        around 30,000 tonnes. Applying the learnings from the smaller scale demo
        set-up while embracing engineering insights from lateral industries like
        agriculture, water treatment plants and others. Methodology that will
        enable Photanol to compete extremely favorably with non-renewable
        chemicals. Proving that sustainability isn’t second place to economic
        profit."

    - year: "2024"
      title: Commercial production
      text: "Our first commercial plant is planned to kick-off production in 2024.
        Rest assured, our upscaling teams are working hard to optimize and
        maximize production. Constantly iterating to evidence that Photanol is
        not only the most future-proof solution but also the solution with the
        lowest footprint of any sustainable option. Our economically sound
        business cases and new tech breakthroughs acting as instruments in our
        mission to restore balance to the planet, while powering the world. "

  title: "Cyanobacteria: natural, all-in-one factories."
  text: >-
    Petro-chemicals mean mining more fossil fuel; emitting more carbon. They’re
    also resource, land and time thirsty; the kind of industry that has led to a
    planet out of balance. The Photanol solution helps reset that balance. 


    We can create any carbon compound. Which means we can make the monomers used for different plastics, the ingredients commonly used in personal care products and detergents; even fuels - clean, renewable and circular. All thanks to innovation that follows nature’s lead. 


    Photanol works with the superpower of cyanobacteria to photosynthesize. Optimizing the bacteria to absorb more CO2, adapting its metabolic pathways to produce a desired chemical. Transforming the bacteria into highly-efficient mini factories that run on sunlight, produce just oxygen as by-product and need radically less land and water than traditional variants. All primed for scalability thanks to Photanol’s platform technology.
